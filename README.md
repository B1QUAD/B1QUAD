### Hello there, I'm David.

Feel free to open an issue or drop a PR on any of my projects if you have any ideas for improvements or just want to ask me a question. 

Note: I'd love to share more of my projects but unfortunately for reasons of academic integrity must keep them set to private for the time being.
